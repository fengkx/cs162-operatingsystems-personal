value of infile: 0x7fffffffe810 
object referenced by infile: a file stream for the file pointed to by infile.
value of ofile: 0x0. This will later become 0x7ffff7dd77c0 <_IO_2_1_stdout_>
difference between ofile and infile (why): ofile and infile are different because the files are different, so the pointers to the files would also be different. ofile is also null until stdout is set.
wc address: 0x400826
explain output of info stack: it shows the contents of the stack.
explain output of info frame: it shows the contents of the current frame.
explain output of info registers: it shows the conents of all the registers.
which registers hold info of recognizable elements of the program: rdi = ofile pointer, rsi = infile pointer, rdx = inname pointer, rbp = locals
